# Desktop_Notifier
Just a simple project, on my journey to software development.
Made with the help of some tuts.

To run this, you need to install Plyer, which is a Python library for desktop notifications.
More on Plyer: [Plyer Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/plyer/)

For installation on Linux,
```pip install plyer```
